Watch this video: [Simple Made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)

And this one: [Value of Values](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values)

And this one: [Design, Composition, and Performance](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Design-Composition-Performance)

If the ideas presented in these videos don't jibe with you, then
hacking on this super awesome game probably isn't for you.

## Running The Game

- Install Java 8 (1.8 sdk).
- Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/).
- Install rlwrap (`brew install rlwrap`).
- Clone repo.
- Nav to root directory.
- Run `lein deps`.
- Run `rlwrap lein figwheel`
- Open `index.html` in Chrome.

### Running The Game + Emacs

- Instead of running `rlwrap lein figwheel`, do the following.
- Install plugins: `cider`, `company-mode`.
- Throw these lines into your `init.el`:

```elisp
(add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook #'company-mode)

(add-hook
 'clojurescript-mode-hook
 (lambda ()
   (progn
     (show-paren-mode)
     (paredit-mode)
     (modify-syntax-entry ?- "w"))))

(defun user/cider-send-to-repl ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((s (buffer-substring-no-properties
            (nth 0 (cider-last-sexp 'bounds))
            (nth 1 (cider-last-sexp 'bounds)))))
    (with-current-buffer (cider-current-connection)
      (insert s)
      (cider-repl-return))))
```

- In `~/.lein/profiles.clj` add the following lines:
```clojure
{:user {:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.12.0-snapshot"]]
        :dependencies [[org.clojure/tools.nrepl "0.2.12"]]}}
```
- In Emacs, first time you open a `.cljs` file run: `M-x cider-jack-in-clojurescript`.
- You can use `repl.cljs` to interact with the applications.
- To send a block to the browser use `M-x user/cider-send-to-repl`.
- To view the output of a block within in Emacs use `M-x cider-eval-last-sexp`.
- If you don't get autocompletion, make sure `cider-mode` is enabled
  for the current buffer (you may want to start and stop it again for
  good measure).

## JavaScript to ClojureScript

Here are some examples of how to translate ES2016 + JSX
to ClojureScript + Sablono.

## Defining a Function

```javascript
function sayHello(name, otherName) {
  return `${name} says hello to ${otherName}`;
}
```

```clojure
(defn say-hello [name other-name]
  (str name " says hello to " other-name))
```

- Names in ClojureScript are `kebab-cased` as opposed to `camelCased`.
- Functions in ClojureScript implicitly return the last symbolic
  expression (an sexp is basically the last parenthetical set).
- There are only four types of delimiters in ClojureScript. The token
  delimiter is a space ` `, and the block delimiter can be any
  closing pair: `)`, `}`, `]`.
- ClojureScript's `str` function joins multiple strings together.
- You really need to get used to editing with plugins similar to
  `paredit`. Balancing parenthesis are not fun, using a plugin will
  make _manipulating_ s-expressions trivial (lisp dialects are
  _not_ about manipulating closing parens like most devs think):
  - Emacs had `paredit` built in.
  - [Vim](https://github.com/vim-scripts/paredit.vim)
  - [Sublime Text](https://github.com/odyssomay/paredit)
  - [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/lisp-paredit)

## Defining a Hash/Dictionary

```javascript
function newPerson(firstName, lastName) {
  return {
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,
    fullName: firstName + ' ' + lastName
  };
}
```

```clojure
(defn new-person [first-name, last-name]
  {:first-name first-name
   :last-name last-name
   :full-name (str first-name " " last-name)})
```

- Dictionaries in ClojureScript are denoted by the `{}` literal. The key
  values are just _paired items_ between the `{}` (you'll get a
  compiler error if you have a `{}` with an odd number of items). You
  can add `,` if you want, but ClojureScript just considers `,` as
  whitespace.
- For accessing dictionary values: in JavaScript you
  would do `person.firstName`, in ClojureScript it's `(:first-name
  person)`.

## Defining Local Variables

```javascript
function newPerson(firstName, middleName, lastName) {
  let fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
  let middleInitial = middleName[0];
  return {
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,
    middleName: middleName,
    fullName: firstName + ' ' + lastName
  };
}
```

```clojure
(defn new-person [first-name middle-name last-name]
  (let [full-name (str first-name " " middle-name " " last-name)
        middle-initial (first middle-name)]
    {:first-name first-name
     :middle-name middle-name
     :middle-initial middle-initial
     :last-name last-name
     :full-name full-name}))
```

The `let` binding takes in an array of pairs (similar to a map
`{}`). An odd numbered array will give you a compiler error.

## Anonymous Functions

```javascript
function multipleAllByTwo(array) {
  return _.map(array, function(value) {
    return value * 2;
  });
}

multipleAllByTwo([1, 2, 3]); //yields [2, 4, 6]
```

```clojure
(defn multiply-all-by-two [array]
  (map array (fn [value] (* value 2))))

(multiply-all-by-two [1 2 3]) ;;yields [2 4 6]
```

Anonymous functions can be written with the following shorthand. You
can use `#()` instead of `(fn [arg1 arg2])`. Parameters names for the
`#()` shorthand are `%`, `%2`, `%3`, etc. Here is the same
`multiply-all-by-two` but using the `#()` shorthand.

```clojure
;;before
(defn multiply-all-by-two [array]
  (map array (fn [value] (* value 2))))

;;after
(defn multiply-all-by-two [array]
  (map array #(* % 2)))

(multiply-all-by-two [1 2 3]) ;;yields [2 4 6]
```

## JavaScript Interop

```javascript
window.alert("hodor");
console.log("hodor");
console.log({ a: "value 1", b: "value 2"});
```

```clojure
(.alert js/window "hodor")
(.log js/console "hodor")
(.log js/console (clj->js #{a: "value 1" b: "value 2"}))
```

All interop is under the `js/` prefix. You have to use `clj->js` to
convert from a ClojureScript data structure to a JavaScript data
structure. You wont be doing this often, but it's good to know.


## ES2015 Classes + JSX vs Namespaced Functions + Sablono

```javascript
import { Component } from 'react';

export class PeopleView extends Component {
  sayHello() { console.log('Hello'); }

  renderPerson(person) {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{person.firstName} {person.lastName}</p>
        <a href="#" onClick={this.sayHello.bind(this)}>Say Hello</a>
      </div>
    );
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.renderPerson(this.props.person1)}
        {this.renderPerson(this.props.person2)}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

<PeopleView
  person1={{firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe"}}
  person2={{firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe"}}
/>
```

Here is the ClojureScript version using a library called Sablono
(the library converts arrays of elements into React components).

```clojure
(ns people-view
  (:require [sablono.core :as sab])

(defn say-hello []
  (.log js/console "Hello"))

(defn person-view [person]
  [:div
    [:p (str (:first-name person) " " (:last-name person))]
    [:a {:href "#" :on-click say-hello} "Say Hello"]])

(defn people-view [person-1 person-2]
  (sab/html
    [:div
      (render-person person-1)
      (render-person person-2)]))

(people-view
  {:first-name "Jane" :last-name "Doe"}
  {:first-name "John" :last-name "Doe"})
```

### Application State - Defining Atoms

With respect to front end application state (and in this case
`React`), you need some means of storing said application state
globally. React solves this with various different techniques, such as
using a Flux architecture (eg. Redux), or using a "container"
`React.Component` where everything is stored in the top level
`state` property (and updated via `setState`).

ClojureScript has a concept of an `atom` which is a transactional
object that can be passed by _reference_. In ClojureScript everything is
immutable, so being able to pass something by reference is a unique
trait.

Instead of using a React component's `props` attribute (and
`setState`). We can use an `atom` defined top level:

```clojure
(def app-state
  (atom {:team-at-home []
         :team []
         :location :home
         :chosen nil
         :battling nil}))
```

Aside: Using `def` is similar to using `var`/`let` in JavaScript. Infact, defining a
function `(defn say-hello [param] )` is shorthand for `(def say-hello (fn [params] ))`.

In JavaScript + React, when you what a control hierarchy to render, you would
create a method similar to `addPerson` which calls `setState` (calling
this method eventually makes the React control hierarchy rerender):

```javascript
import { Component } from 'react';

export class PeopleView extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      people: [
        { firstName: 'Jane', lastName: 'Doe' },
        { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' },
      ]
    };
  }

  addPerson(firstName, lastName) {
    this.setState({
        people: this.state.people.concat({
          firstName: firstName,
          lastName: lastName
        });
      });
  }
}
```

In ClojureScript, instead of using `setState`, you can use an `atom`
and its `swap!` function:

```clojure
(def app-state
  (atom
    {:people [{:first-name "Jane"
               :last-name "Doe"}
              {:first-name "Jane"
               :last-name "Doe"}]}))

(defn on-add-person [first-name last-name]
  (swap! app-state
         merge
         {:people (conj (:people @app-state)
                        {:first-name first-name
                        :last-name last-name})}))
```

To get the value from an `atom`, you must first dereference it. This
is done by preceding the `atom` with an `@` sign. If we want to create
a new application state from an existing one, you would do something
like this:

Given an `atom` called `app-state` with the following value:

```clojure
(def app-state
  (atom
    {:people [{:first-name "Jane"
               :last-name "Doe"}
              {:first-name "Jane"
               :last-name "Doe"}]}))
```

You would concatenate the new person using the `conj` ClojureScript
function, with the value currently in the `app-state` (dereferencing
the current value using `@`).

```clojure
{:people
  (conj (:people @app-state)
        {:first-name "Baby"
         :last-name "Doe"})}
```

To update `app-state` atomcially, we use `swap!`, giving it the `atom`
as the first parameter, what function we want to run on the `atom` (in
this case it's `merge`), and what value we want to merge in. Putting
all that together we get:

```clojure
(defn on-add-person [first-name last-name]
  (swap! app-state
         merge
         {:people (conj (:people @app-state)
                        {:first-name first-name
                        :last-name last-name})}))
```

As soon as `swap!` is called. Sablono propagates those changes
throughout all the React components.

Aside: Details of `merge` and `conj` along with other ClojureScript
functions are covered in the next section.

## You Don't Need Lodash When Using ClojureScript

Let's go through some Lodash functions and see how those look on
ClojureScript:

### `map`

todo

### `merge`

todo

### `conj`
